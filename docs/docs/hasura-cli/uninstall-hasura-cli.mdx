# Uninstalling The Hasura CLI

## Uninstall a binary

If you installed the binary directly on your system (probably through
shell script), delete the binary file from its installation location.

```bash
# By Default, The Binary Is Installed At /Usr/Local/Bin/Hasura
$ which hasura
  /usr/local/bin/hasura

# Use Sudo If Required
$ rm /usr/local/bin/hasura
```

## Uninstall an npm package

If you installed the CLI as an npm package, use npm (or yarn).

```bash
# If Installed As A Project Dependency
npm uninstall hasura-cli

# If Installed As A Global Package
npm uninstall --global hasura-cli
```
